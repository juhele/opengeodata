# Amateur gamma spectrometry with pocket spectrometer RadiaCode-101

As part of the task, a commercial produced, affordable pocket spectrometer RadiaCode-101 based on a Csl (Tl) detector will be tested, focusing on the support of so-called citizen measurements and possible quick orientation measurements for the needs of radiation situation assessment by SÚRO employees.

Measured gamma spectrometric data of various radioactive materials will be available on this website - from natural (minerals, rocks) through materials of natural origin (NORM) to various radionuclide sources available to SÚRO emploees. This site will also allow data to be published to other volunteers within the user community.

**About the device**

RadiaCode-101 is a pocket scintillation radiation detector + gamma spectrometer manufactured by Scan-Electronics, Russia). It uses 10×10×10mm CsI (Caesium iodide) scintillation crystal coupled with silicon photomultiplier (SiPM). The device can be used independently, but most of its possibilities can be used when connected to a smartphone and the RadiaCode application. The device can be used for gamma dose rater mapping (GPS data is used from a connected smartphone) or for gamma spectrometry. Otput spectra have 256 channel resolution and can be shared in XML format, which can be directly viewed by other users with RadiaCode application or in other, possibly custom developed programs. Conversion to CSV is also possible. Gamma spectrometry was the reason why SÚRO bought two units in the second half of 2021.
