# opengeodata

This repository will contain open geographic data of various sort I created for me or some of my projects.

Datasets currently available (see subfolders above):

- DEMO Airborne gammaspectrometric data "Uluru" - using IRIS airborne gamma-ray spectrometric system developed by Pico Envirotec Inc. Company in Toronto, Canada - real data - all the radiation data incl. dose rate values, raw 512 channel spectra etc., changed location (to well known Uluru/Ayers Rock, Australia)

- DEMO Airborne gammaspectrometric data 2 "Tongariro" - using IRIS airborne gamma-ray spectrometric system developed by Pico Envirotec Inc. Company in Toronto, Canada - real data - all the radiation data incl. dose rate values, raw 512 channel spectra etc., changed location (to Tongariro National Park, New Zealand)

- DRONES-G demo UAV measurement data - data from UAV gammaspectrometric system DRONES-G - real data - all the radiation data incl. dose rate values, raw 1024 channel spectra etc., changed location

- ERS (European Radiometric and Spectrometry format) - demo data for software development and testing

- DEMO ground radiation monitoring data from Mob-DOSE detector - data were measured using the Mob-DOSE (also called PDOSE-3) portable device, with native output in PEI format defined by Pico Envirotec, the radiation data are real but the location and time/date parameters were changed

- GIS supporting layers - various sources of geographic data for easy use in GIS - primarily targeted at QGIS

- uranium mines and deposits

- world nuclear power reactors

- US DOE/NNSA Response to 2011 Fukushima Incident: Raw Aerial Data and Extracted Ground Exposure Rates and Cesium Deposition

- amateur gamma spectrometry with pocket spectrometer RadiaCode-101 - will contain publicly available spectrometric data (both naturan and man-made, various radionuclide sources, minerals, NORM materials) measured with this pocket device

Todo:

- world nuclear research and other reactors

- update "uranium mines and deposits" with data from other countries
