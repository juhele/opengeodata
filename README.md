# opengeodata

This repository will contain open geographic data of various sort I created for me or some of my projects.

Datasets currently available (see subfolders above):

- DEMO Airborne gammaspectrometric data "Uluru" - using using IRIS airborne gamma-ray spectrometric system developed by Pico Envirotec Inc. Company in Toronto, Canada - real data - all the radiation data incl. dose rate values, raw 512 channel spectra etc., changed location (to well known Uluru/Ayers Rock, Australia)

- ERS (European Radiometric and Spectrometry format) - demo data for software development and testing

- DEMO ground radiation monitoring data from Mob-DOSE detector - data were measured using the Mob-DOSE (also called PDOSE-3) portable device, with native output in PEI format defined by Pico Envirotec, the radiation data are real but the location and time/date parameters were changed

- uranium mines and deposits

- world nuclear power reactors

- US DOE/NNSA Response to 2011 Fukushima Incident: Raw Aerial Data and Extracted Ground Exposure Rates and Cesium Deposition

Todo:

- world nuclear research and other reactors

- update "uranium mines and deposits" with data from other countries
