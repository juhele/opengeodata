# European Atlas of Natural Radiation datasets for QGIS etc.

The aim of this website is to facilitate the use of [European Atlas of Natural Radiation](https://remon.jrc.ec.europa.eu/About/Atlas-of-Natural-Radiation) datasets published in the [Joint Research Centre (JRC) Data Catalogue](https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/id-0057) in GIS applications - e.g. [QGIS](https://qgis.org/) or [SAGA GIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/).

Data modification includes correcting/fixing the coordinate system/projection definition and conversion to another GIS formats:

- [GeoTIFF File Format](https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/raster/gtiff.html)

- [SAGA GIS Binary Grid File Format](https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/raster/sdat.html)

Each data package available here contains original and modified data, a description of the data with proper credits, a link to the original source, and a copyright notice.
