# Simulated radiation monitoring data for training and testing purposes

These datasets could be useful for training - data processing, conversions, creating maps etc. or development / testing new software tools as the data can be freely distributed.

Currently only dose rate measurements are available, spectrometry data will hopefully be added later.

## Ground radiation monitoring (walking / carborne) ##

The data were measured using the Mob-DOSE (also called PDOSE-3) portable device, with native output in PEI format defined by Pico Envirotec. Can be opened (and was also tested) using PEI software like [PEIView](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/peiview/) or [PEIConvert](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/peiconvert/).

"Equipped with two energy compensated Geiger Tubes, the device covers a wide range of measurements from 50nSv/h up to 400 mSv/h of GDER (Gamma-Dose Equivalent Rate)." (equipment description source -  [NUVIA Dynamics website](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/pdose-3/))

### Simulated walk monitoring "Stromovka" ###

The data do not contain any values above normal radiation background
